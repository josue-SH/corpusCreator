# Corpus Creator

I'm using this document to learn a few things about text mining. First, I will use the [corporaexplorer package](https://kgjerde.github.io/corporaexplorer/) on one of my favorite books, The Savage Detectives by Roberto Bola√±o. I will use the internet archive API to download the text, either in .txt or .pdf format, and then use the aforementioned R package to visualize the counts of certain key words.

My goal is to be able to create an app that can create a text corpus using the internet archive, which is a free source of books.
